Welcome to our project!

In this project we use data mining techniques to analyze the global trade network.

Our dataset includes information about imports and exports, trading partners, year and commodity.
Each of these variables contains interesting information and we explored each in depth.

Our data analysis process was interactive and iterative so, unlike a predictor, it is difficult to reproduce our results by running code once.
We had many scratch files that we used for data exploration but we condensed and deleted them for your ease of use.
Instead we have included a script that outputs some of the the results that we have included in the report.
We have also attached a Jupyter notebook that we used for data exploration and visualization.
Note that we used the Jupyter notebooks as sandbox environments so they may not run out of the box. Even so, it may be a useful reference for our visualizations.

If you only want to run certain parts of the script alter the boolean variables at the top of run_project.py

To run the script simply use "python run_project.py". Output will display to the console.

We hope you enjoy our project!
