Welcome to our project!

In this project we use data mining techniques to analyze the global trade network.

Our dataset includes information about imports and exports, trading partners, year and commodity.
Each of these variables contains interesting information and we explored each in depth.
May output files are created for different categories and different years that we used for data exploration.
In future work we would refactor this code to make it faster and store information in memory instead of parsing to files.
Our data analysis process was interactive and iterative so, unlike a predictor, it is difficult to reproduce our results by running code once.
Instead we have included a script that outputs some of the the results that we have included in the report.
We have also attached the Jupyter notebooks that we used for data exploration and visualization.

If you only want to run certain parts of the script alter the boolean variables at the top of run_project.py

To run the script simply use "python run_project.py". Output will display to the console.

We hope you enjoy our project!
